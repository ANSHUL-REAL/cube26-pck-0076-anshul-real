"""Evidence records: building, hashing, verifying and overriding.

content_hash is SHA-256 over the record's canonical JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace,
content_hash itself excluded). It covers the hashes of the stored photos. It makes any
edit to a record detectable when the record is compared with its hash. It is NOT an
append-only log or an externally anchored proof, and we don't claim it is.
